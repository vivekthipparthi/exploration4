==================================================================================================
<p>As part of the Exploration4, ReactJS is widely in talk in the Industry and can be seen in almost all the job requirements. This is my very first React application, I started to learn it from the scratch and developed a basic application called Contact Manager where we can save the contacts in the application and can delete them with delete button in the application. As it my first application in React I explored plenty of things like starting an application in React, Rendering and DOM properties in React</p>
